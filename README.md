# NFTs as Access Keys for Confidential Data Vaults

This project harnesses **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology** to revolutionize how sensitive data is managed and accessed. By allowing users to store their encrypted data in a decentralized vault, we provide a secure method of accessing and managing personal information through NFTs that serve as access keys. 

## The Challenge of Data Privacy

In today's digital landscape, individuals face an increasing risk of data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Despite advancements in data security, traditional methods often fall short, leaving users vulnerable when managing their personal information. As vast amounts of data are created daily, the need for an innovative solution that caters to individual privacy and security is more critical than ever.

## The FHE Solution

Our project introduces a groundbreaking solution by combining NFTs and Zama's FHE technology. By encrypting sensitive data using Zama's open-source libraries—like **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**—users can securely store their information in a decentralized vault without the risk of exposure. Access to this vault is granted through NFTs, which represent the ownership and access rights to the encrypted data. This innovative approach not only enhances privacy but also empowers users by allowing them to trade or transfer their data access rights as assets, thus maintaining control over their personal information.

## Core Functionalities

The NFTs as Access Keys project includes several key features:

- **FHE Encrypted Data Storage**: Users can store sensitive data in a decentralized vault, ensuring that it remains confidential and secure.
- **NFT Access Rights**: Ownership of an NFT signifies access to the associated encrypted data, enabling straightforward and secure access management.
- **Homomorphic Verification for Holders**: Users can verify their access rights homomorphically without revealing the underlying data.
- **Assetization and Tradeability**: The project allows NFT holders to trade their data access rights in a secure marketplace, promoting personal data sovereignty.

## Technology Stack

The development of this project relies on the following technologies:

- **Zama SDK**: The foundation for confidential computing.
- **Hardhat or Foundry**: Frameworks for building and testing Ethereum-based smart contracts.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Solidity**: The programming language for developing smart contracts.

## Installation Guide

To get started with this project, follow these setup instructions:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. It can be downloaded from the official website.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory using your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will fetch the necessary libraries, including Zama's FHE libraries, ensuring that your environment is ready to build and run the project securely.

## Build & Run Instructions

After setting up the project, use the following commands to compile and run the project:

1. Compile the smart contracts:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. Run the tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. Deploy the smart contracts to the desired network:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

   Replace `<network_name>` with the appropriate Ethereum network you wish to deploy to.

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s a small code snippet demonstrating how to mint an NFT that grants access to encrypted data:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract Nft_Key_Fhe is ERC721 {
    mapping(uint256 => string) private _dataHashes;

    constructor() ERC721("NFT Key FHE", "NFTKFHE") {}

    function mintNFT(address to, uint256 tokenId, string memory dataHash) public {
        _mint(to, tokenId);
        _dataHashes[tokenId] = dataHash; // Storing the hash of the encrypted data
    }

    function getDataHash(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (string memory) {
        return _dataHashes[tokenId];
    }
}
```

This contract enables the creation of NFTs that represent access to encrypted data, providing a unique solution for personal data management.
